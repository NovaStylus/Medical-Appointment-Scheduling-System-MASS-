#Effective medical service delivery is crucial to Tanzania's healthcare system, particularly in light of the growing need for high-quality care in both urban and rural areas. Nevertheless, a lot of hospitals continue to use manual appointment scheduling procedures, which are laborious, prone to mistakes, and frequently annoying for both patients and medical staff. Poor scheduling systems, lengthy lines, and misunderstandings all lead to inefficient services and unhappy patients.

#We created the Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS), a web-based platform intended to automate and digitize the patient appointment procedure in Tanzanian hospitals, in order to address these issues. By choosing hospital departments (such pediatrics, cardiology, or general medicine), MASS enables patients to register and schedule appointments. Then, the doctors assigned to those departments take care of the appointments.
